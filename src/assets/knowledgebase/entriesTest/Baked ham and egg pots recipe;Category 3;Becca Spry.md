2.  Arrange the ham in the bottom of a ramekin dish so that it forms a cup and place the basil inside. Spoon in the crème fraîche and crack in the egg. Sprinkle over the Red Leicester and season with salt and pepper.
    
3.  Place the ramekin on a baking tray and bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked but the yolk is still a little runny.
