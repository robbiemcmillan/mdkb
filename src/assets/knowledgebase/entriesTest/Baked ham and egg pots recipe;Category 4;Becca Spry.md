## Ingredients

-   1 x 30g/1oz slice of [ham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/ham)
-   4 fresh [basil](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/basil) leaves
-   1 tbsp half-fat [crème fraîche](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/creme_fraiche)
-   1 large free-range [egg](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/egg)
-   1 tbsp grated [Red Leicester](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/red_leicester_cheese)
-   sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

### To serve

-   [salad leaves](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/salad_leaves)
-   [olive oil](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/olive_oil), for drizzling
-   squeeze of [lemon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/lemon)

## Method

1.  Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3½.
    
2.  Arrange the ham in the bottom of a ramekin dish so that it forms a cup and place the basil inside. Spoon in the crème fraîche and crack in the egg. Sprinkle over the Red Leicester and season with salt and pepper.
    
3.  Place the ramekin on a baking tray and bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked but the yolk is still a little runny.
    
4.  Put the salad leaves on a plate, dress with a drizzle of oil and a squeeze of lemon juice and serve with the ham and egg pot.
